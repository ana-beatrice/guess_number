# guess_number
Guessing a random number given by the computer.


The purpose of this project is delivering a random number between 1 to 100. 
When the user input is bigger or smaller than the number that needs to be guessed, the user gets a message that says "is too small" or "is too big" and has to continue the game. 
If the user guessed the number, the programm asks if you want to continue or to stop. 
In case the number is not guessed or the user don't want to play anymore, by typing "done" the programm is finished.
